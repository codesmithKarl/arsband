- game divided into Ages of several hundred years (seperated by Interregna of unspecified length)
- Age finishes when
    - the Enemy of that Age is defeated
    - all covenants of that Age are lost

- notable events in an Age:
    - Emperor
    - Grand Genius

- more detailed history also recorded

- more powerful items/writings etc are more likely to survive an Interregnum

- tables kept across Ages:
  - Winners
      incl. Magi, Covenant and Age data
  - Emperors
  - Grand Genii
  - Magi
      Age, highest Art, #spell levels, best writings, best items, best familiars, etc
  - Covenants
      resources, writings, enchantments, auras/regio, vis sources, ???
  - Writings
  - Enchantments
  - Spells

- RoR-derived events/resources/decisions (extended to last up to 500 years ie 10x)
- Magi from all Covenants meet every 7 years as the Senate: officers elected, etc.  Senate can elect Grand Genius.
    Generally Magi from the same Covenant will act together in the Senate.
- Each Covenant meets on the 2nd and 5th years of the cycle as a Council.
    Both companions and magi have a vote.
    A combination of a Magi and several companions within a Covenant form a House
    (companions can move between Houses).
- Magi can oppose the Senate: a victorius Magi becomes Emperor

- Magi can ignore Senate/Council politics and concentrate on defeating Morgoth or searching for old secrets 
  (including remnants of Covenants from past Ages)

- Defeating Morgoth includes investigating one or several dungeons, killing things and taking their stuff.
- Angband-style random generation of dungeons, things and their stuff (but not Too Much Junk)
- Ars 5th edition style combat.
- In order to defeat Morgoth it is also necessary to research secrets and solve problems using library resources.
- There is also an FA-style overworld, where the covenants and various possible resources/allies/enemies are located.
- Gathering the resources to defeat Morgoth may take the combined resources of several centuries-old covenants.


- There is an OOC Arena/Observation Deck where you may set up combats between a snapshot of your Magi and any 
  possible opponent, including arranging the site of the conflict (arena). 
- Some sort of Arena-only victory tables will also be kept.

- Many/most Magi (and all companions) are AI robots/borg. 
- Robots will use various AI implementations, and have various game-level foci, 
  including using Ars Magica style Houses as goal/methodology templates. Some implementation of personality as well.
- Some Borg will participate in the Arena competitions.

- Borg Magi will discuss plans, tactics, strategy, etc with players and with each other across various 
  communication channels within the game. 

- Some robots on the Observation Deck act as tutors/advisors/assistants for players. 
- Also the Observation Deck will have an AI crowd which will observe the fighting in the Arenas and cheer, jeer and mutter.

- The game runs on TinyMUSH 3.1+ softcode, possibly with a Python extension module for spells and other magical abilities.
- The victory tables are maintained in a MySQL database also visible from a website.
- A game blog/forum will include borg-written postings from inside the game.
- The borg are written in a combination of C++0x and Python 3.0. They communicate mainly in Gellish, with some
  additional capacity to analyse English.
