ArsBand MUSH is a collection of software, divided into 3 inter-related groups.

- The MUSH server and associated softcode
- The MUSH database and content generators
- The robots

Each group should have automated Acceptance Tests (written in FIT or cucumber) 
and Unit Tests (written in rspec or UnitTest++). Additionally there should be automated
Integration Tests written in cucumber and rspec crossing all three groups.
